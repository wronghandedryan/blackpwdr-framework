# Cryptex Change Log

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [development]

Nothing yet!

## [v1.0.1] - 2019-09-11

### Changed

- The formatting of the codebase has been updated to use Prettier + ESLint
- Upgraded all dependencies, resolving dependency security issues
- Running tests now requires a Node.js environment that supports async/await

### Fixed

- Calling the `file` key source without a `path` option would previously reject with only a string. It now rejects with an Error object.

## [v1.0.0] - 2016-07-15

### Added

- CLI now has a --file (-f) argument for specifying a non-default json configuration file
- Cryptex now resolves relative config file paths

### Changed

- Babel has been removed. Cryptex now requires Node version 4 or higher.

### Fixed

- Super-long integers passed in on the CLI for encryption are no longer automatically rounded by Javascript. ([#5](https://github.com/TomFrost/Cryptex/issues/5))
- Inaccuracies in the README documentation ([#3](https://github.com/TomFrost/Cryptex/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/TomFrost/Cryptex/pull/4))

## [v0.6.1] - 2015-11-13

### Fixed

- Encrypting numbers no longer results in a huge encrypted RAM block! Numbers are now treated as strings.

## [v0.6.0] - 2015-10-28

### Added

- Cryptex CLI now understands getSecret command, and makes Cryptex useful in non-Node.js projects!

## [v0.5.0] - 2015-10-28

### Added

- getSecrets() method for more efficient secret retrieval batching

### Changed

- Cryptex now rejects on encrypt/decrypt/getSecret when a keySource isn't explicitly set. This provides far better error messaging when Cryptex isn't properly configured.
- The CLI now produces shockingly better error messages.

## [v0.4.1] - 2015-10-27

### Fixed

- Babel doesn't transpile String.prototype.includes, breaking 0.12 compatibility. This has been corrected.

## [v0.4.0] - 2015-10-27

### Added

- Optional flag for getSecret().

### Changed

- getSecret() treats secrets as required by default, and rejects if one isn't found.

## [v0.3.1] - 2015-10-27

### Fixed

- AES256 now handles strings longer than the key

## [v0.3.0] - 2015-10-26

### Changed

- Calling getSecret() for a missing secret now resolves to null instead of rejecting. This is in an effort to separate actual key source failures from a possibly optional secret.

## [v0.2.2] - 2015-10-26

### Fixed

- Package aws-sdk; not having it caused too many issues
- Errors in modules no longer get swallowed on require

## [v0.2.1] - 2015-10-26

### Fixed

- Invalid build to NPM

## [v0.2.0] - 2015-10-26

### Added

- Travis.ci testing
- CodeClimate
- 'region' KMS option

### Changed

- Minor documentation corrections

### Fixed

- Relative path issues when requiring modules
- CLI's -e flag not being observed

## v0.1.0 - 2015-10-23

### Added

- Initial release
